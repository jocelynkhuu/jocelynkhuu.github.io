        <p>I took the Security+ exam back in 2020 when covid hit. It had always been a goal of mine to pass as I heard from many people that it would be a good entry level cert into Security.</p>
<h3 id="the-testing-experience">The Testing Experience</h3>
<p>I took the test via OnVue and was super nervous about potential issues from all the horror stories of online proctors. Luckily, I didn’t experience any issues when taking my exam and everything ran smoothly.</p>
<p>Like lots of others I thought I had failed for sure during the test. I flagged all PBQs and dedicated about 30 minutes after finishing the multiple choice to go over them. I ran out of time in the end to double-check all of my answers but made sure to submit something on all of the questions regardless of whether I was sure or not.</p>
<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Darril Gibson&rsquo;s GCGA</li>
<li>Professor Messer&rsquo;s Practice Exams and Videos</li>
<li>Jason Dion&rsquo;s Udemy Practice Exams</li>
<li>Mike Chapple&rsquo;s Cert Prep (Linkedin Learning)</li>
</ul>
<p>I mainly watched Prof. Messer&rsquo;s and Mike Chapple&rsquo;s videos at 1.75x speed to help clarify things I didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I spent about a month of serious studying and dedicated about 4-5 hours of study after work. I ended up passing with an 825.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-helpful-for-me">What was helpful for me</h3>
<p>Practice Exams! The practice exams really gave me an idea of what I needed to focus on. I wasn&rsquo;t scoring very high on Dion&rsquo;s practice exams (low to mid 70s) but on Prof. Messer&rsquo;s exams I was getting mid to high 80s. I would definitely recommend purchasing Prof. Messer&rsquo;s exams as they were super helpful.</p>
<p>A year and half later, I have found that while the cert did help me with gaining basic security knowledge, it wasn&rsquo;t very helpful for helping me land a job. I don&rsquo;t think that companies value the cert as much as people say they do. I would still recommed getting the cert as it definitely teaches good foundations that are important during interviews.</p>

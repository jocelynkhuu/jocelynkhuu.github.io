      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took the Security+ exam back in 2020 when covid hit. It had always been a goal of mine to pass as I heard from many people that it would be a good entry level cert into Security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-testing-experience&#34;&gt;The Testing Experience&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I took the test via OnVue and was super nervous about potential issues from all the horror stories of online proctors. Luckily, I didnâ€™t experience any issues when taking my exam and everything ran smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://khuuj.com/static/entrylevel.png&#34; alt=&#34;Entry Level&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started my first Endpoint Security Engineer role late last month and I wanted to write down how I was able to finally break into security. This is going to be written in a journal style as this is just my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some context, here is my work experience:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;5 years of IT support experience overall&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 years at a FAANG doing internal IT support&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;6 months running IT at a startup as the sole IT person&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I honestly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that I&amp;rsquo;m the most technical person in the world but I definitely have a lot of interest in learning new technologies, automation, and tinkering with tech such as Raspberry Pis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
